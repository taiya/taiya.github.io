# Hiring graduate students
If you want to push the boundary of computer vision with machine learning towards effective understanding of the 3D world, with applications to autonomous systems/robotics, inverse graphics, and augmented reality, please <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html"> apply here </a> – **the application deadline is mid-January 2026**.
I typically only accept PhD students, as MSc positions are dedicated to domestic students.
Postdoc positions are rare, and you will need either an NSERC scholarship, or an industrial partner to support you.
To apply to my group, simply mention my name in [the application system](https://www.sfu.ca/gradstudies/apply/applying/gograd.html).
For inquiries about graduate applications, you can email <a href = "mailto:andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca">andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca</a>, but I would kindly ask prospective students to **not email me prior to Dec 15**, and before submitting your formal application.
I will go through all the applications with my name included, and will review your CV, and transcripts then (there is no point in sending these by email attachment!).
If you do have any specific questions or ideas you want to share with me, please only do so after Dec 15 **and** submitting your application.
If you have read these guidelines, please start your email subject with **Potato26**.
