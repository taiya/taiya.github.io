# Hiring graduate students
If you want to push the boundary of computer vision with machine learning towards effective understanding of the 3D world, with applications to autonomous systems/robotics, inverse graphics, and augmented reality, please <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html"> apply here </a> – **the application deadline is mid-January 2026**.
I typically only accept PhD students, as MSc positions are dedicated to domestic students.
Postdoc positions are rare, and you will need either an NSERC scholarship, or an industrial partner to support you.
To apply to my group, simply mention my name in [the application system](https://www.sfu.ca/gradstudies/apply/applying/gograd.html).
For inquiries about graduate applications, you can email <a href = "mailto:andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca">andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca</a>, but I would kindly ask you to **not email me before Dec 15, 2025**, or, even worse, send reminders (I get thousands of emails).
If you want to send your CV, transcripts, and cover letter, that is what the application system is designed for.
