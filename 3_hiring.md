# Hiring graduate students (Sep. 2024 entry)
I am currently hiring graduate students to join my lab. If you want to push the boundary of computer vision with machine learning towards effective understanding of the 3D world, with applications to autonomous systems/robotics, inverse graphics, and augmented reality, please <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html"> apply here </a> – **the application deadline is mid-January 2024**.
To apply to my group, simply mention my name in [the application system](https://www.sfu.ca/gradstudies/apply/applying/gograd.html).
Please only use <a href = "mailto:andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca">andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca</a> for inquiries about graduate admissions (admission emails sent to other recipients are auto-deleted). I promise to read all emails, however, I am likely unable to reply to individual inquiries due to the volume.
