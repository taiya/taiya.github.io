# Hiring graduate students (Sep. 2023)
I am currently hiring graduate students to join my lab. If you want to push the boundary of computer vision with machine learning towards effective understanding of the 3D world, with applications to autonomous systems/robotics, inverse graphics, and augmented reality, please <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html"> apply here </a> â€“ **the application deadline is in mid-January, 2023, and I have two positions open**. To apply to my group, simply mention my name in [the application system](https://www.sfu.ca/gradstudies/apply/applying/gograd.html).
Please use <a href = "mailto:andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca">andrea.tagliasacchi+hiring@sfu.ca</a> for inquiries about graduate admissions (admission emails sent to other recipients are auto-deleted).
Further, use this channel carefully, and only if there is something that you would like to bring to my attention.
